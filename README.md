# Objectives

* Analyze overall coffee sales performance
* Identify top-selling coffee products
* Understand revenue trends over time
* Explore customer purchasing patterns
* Visualize insights for better decision-making



 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information related to coffee sales such as:

* Order details
* Product types
* Quantity sold
* Sales revenue
* Dates / time periods

 Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation
* NumPy – numerical operations
* Matplotlib – data visualization
* Seaborn – advanced visual insights
* Jupyter Notebook



 Steps Performed

1. Data Loading & Inspection

   * Checked dataset shape, columns, and data type
  
2. Data Cleaning

   * Handled missing values
   * Removed duplicates (if any)
   * Converted date columns to proper format

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   * Sales distribution analysis
   * Product-wise and category-wise analysis
   * Revenue trends over time

4. Data Visualization

   * Bar charts for product performance
   * Line plots for sales trends
   * Pie charts for contribution analysis

5. Insights & Observations

   * Identified best-selling products
   * Observed peak sales periods
   * Analyzed customer buying behavior



 Key Insights

* Certain coffee products contribute the majority of total revenue
* Sales show clear trends across different time periods
* Customer demand varies based on product type
* Visual analysis helps in identifying business opportunities


 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **data analysis and visualization** can be used to understand business performance and support decision-making.
